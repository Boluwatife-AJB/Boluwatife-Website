                      <h2>My Favourite Bible Verses</h2>
                      <p>2 Corinthians 6:17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you,</p>
                      <p>2 Corinthians 6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what communion hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness?</p>
                      <p>Romans 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>
                      <p>Romans  8:26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities; for we know what we should pra for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</p>
                      <p>Romans 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according in his purpose.</p>
                      <p>Romans 12:1-2 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>
                      <p>Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.</p>
                      <p>Hebrews 12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>
                      <p>James 1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,  and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
                      <p>1 Peter 2:9  But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</p>                      
                      <p>2 Peter 2:9  The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished</p>
                      <p>Isaiah 40: 28-31 Hast thou not known? Hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding, <sup>29</sup> He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might He increaseth strength. <sub>30</sub> Even the youths shall faint; and be waery, and the young men shall utterly fall: <sup>31</sup> But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</p>
